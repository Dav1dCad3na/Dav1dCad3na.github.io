        <h2>
           The church has emphasized the importance of marriage for almost 2 millennia and its importance to the church is the reason for the existence of the Church of England which rejected papal authority in 1534 when King Henry the 8th wished to annul (The Canceling of a marriage proceeding, Ecessianally a divorce) his marriage with his wife Catherine of Aragon. When he went to ask the catholic church and the pope the pope told him no as it went against the belief that marriage is sacred and once married you cannot separate and it is also a promise (a vow, a declaration) to be with that person until “Death do you part”. So King Henry broke off from the catholic church and helped found the church of England where funnily enough he made divorce legal and allowed a married couple to annul they are promise and commitment (a promise to be together until death, this is usually spoken in vows during the matrimony and is a bond with god) to each other to be together. “Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.” Hebrews 13:4 Our relationship with one another is almost as important or on the same level as our relationship with God since when we marry and procreate (The act of creating offspring, kids, children. This is an important part of marriage, getting married, having kids, and starting a family.) we share in God's power to bring life into the world. “From a valid marriage arises a bond between the spouses which by its very nature is perpetual and exclusive; furthermore, in a Christian marriage, the spouses are strengthened and, as it were, consecrated for the duties and the dignity of their state by a special sacrament.” - Catechism 1638. In the eyes of the church, a marriage is a lifelong union of 2 people becoming one and it is a promise before God to protect and love each other through sickness and in health. The importance of marriage is seen through the church not allowing divorces as it sees it as if there was a reason to separate it would have been heard during the interview with the pope which would have allowed them to tell the other everything possible bad about them and given them a fresh clean slate with no baggage entering into the marriage. This is why the church doesn't allow divorce, the church also asks couples who are to be married within the catholic church to both be interested in bringing life into the world and be part of the fruitful part of the church's FTFF. These 2 parts, the total and fruitful, are what I believe the church attempts to promote healthy couples and help to create a healthy society by ensuring both parents stay in the child's life. Marriage is arguably the first step towards a family and a family is a part of a society. If most come from loving homes as the church wishes to achieve with the FTFF rules then society will be a stronger, more compassionate, and happier society. Marriage and its role in society are emphasized in catechism lines such as The consent by which the spouses mutually give and receive one another is sealed by God himself. From their covenant arises "an institution, confirmed by the divine law, even in the eyes of society." The covenant between the spouses is integrated into God's covenant with man: "Authentic married love is caught up into divine love. Thus the marriage bond has been established by God himself in such a way that a marriage concluded and consummated between baptized persons can never be dissolved. -cc 1639-1641 The church views marriage at such importance to society since it controls the next generation of people/believers and thus the church wants to ensure those kids grow up in a happy home with truthful parents who love each other, and that are in a total commitment to one another.

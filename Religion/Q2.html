        Society is built off of people and people are built off families. 
        Statistically if your parents smoke or drink your chance of smoking or drinking increases more than the classmate whose parents don't, 
        it's simply a nature and a nurture trait and is picked up from the environment. This is simply an example of what kids inherit from their 
        parents and it can create the cycle. So by doing what the catholic church is doing by interviewing couples and determining if they're love is 
        authentic is effectibly filtering out potential bad couples who might not be truthful to each other, or might be an arranged marriage, or another 
        negative reason it can help the catholic church marry couples who are truthful, and authentic to essentially help the future generations by  using 
        the churches idea of FTFF Love. -Still Being worked on-

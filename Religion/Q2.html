        Society is built off of people and people are built off families. Statistically, if your parents smoke or drink your chance of smoking or drinking increases more than the classmate whose parents don't, it's simply a nature and a nurture trait and is picked up from the environment. This is simply an example of what kids inherit from their parents and it can create the cycle. So by doing what the catholic church is doing by interviewing couples and determining if they're love is authentic is effectibly filtering out potential bad couples who might not be truthful to each other, or might be an arranged marriage, or another negative reason it can help the catholic church marry couples who are truthful, and authentic to essentially help the future generations by using the churches idea of FTFF Love. Good marriage is the bedrock for a strong society as a strong marriage creates balanced and mature kids with an idea of what a good relationship is. The idea of a family unit/structure creates a strong base for society to grow around it. Marriage is built of Consent (permission for something to happen or agreement to do something this is important when getting married or having sex to ensure that the other person consents and agrees to the actions) and as a promise to the other person that you are compassionate (Recognizing the suffering of others and then taking action to help. It's a tangible expression of love for those who are suffering or in need.) to their needs and wants. “Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.” Ephesians 5:28. Marriage raises good kids who become the society that live in so it is critical that a high number of children have a good home with married parents so it can outweighs the potentially more unlucky kids who parents divorced or some other case if a majority of people in a society come from good stable homes it can adjust for those who didn’t such as my parents whose parents were divorced so they decided to stay together in sickness and in health when they got married and by turn raised me and my sister who is now raising a family of her own with her husband and they are together and so the healthy cycle continues this creates marriage creates a strong basis for society. Kids raised by married couples tend to be healthier mentally and physically and do better in school when compared to divorced kids from the same demographic. The Fidelity (faithfulness to something to which one is bound by pledge or duty, this can apply to marriage and a pledge to be with that person for the rest of their life.) to their bride or groom as well as to their kids is paramount to they're healthy home environment and by the church promoting family values it creates a solid foundation and bedrock for society. Society to an extent is one big family and it's important that the families that make up society be stable so when they grow old and pass a new generation of stable and mature adults take their place and allow modern society to grow and flourish. CCC-1652 "By its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is ordered to the procreation and education of the offspring and it is in them that it finds its crowning glory."

            My parents married in 1993 and have been married for 31 years and they love each other. They moved here to Canada in 2003 to start a new life and have since given birth to me and had a daughter back in colombia. They came here and worked their way up, they're committed 100% to each other. My mom stayed at home with the kids while my dad went out and worked and worked and worked. They married under the church and were Free to marry each other it was their choice and they were also totally truthful to each other, they have been faithful to each other they're wole marriage, and lastly why were fruitful as they had my sister and I and we were baptized under the church. My parents are the perfect example of a successful marriage and a shining beacon to guide me to one day find someone who loves me as much as my parents love each other.

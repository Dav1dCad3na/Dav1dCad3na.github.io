            A really good example of a healthy marriage and furthermore its importance to society would be phil and claire dunphy's marriage in modern family. Phil is the more fun, energetic and charismatic person although more child-like. While claire is the more mom, serious parent who is running around the house making lunch and breakfast they're opposite minors and in some case similarities make them the perfect couple and they're chemistry is perfect and while their kids aren't perfect who is perfect. The kids have a solid basis for what love is and have loving parents that are they're for whatever they need. Modern family is one of the best examples for a family role in society.
